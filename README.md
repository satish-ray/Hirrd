## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**hirrd** is built as a highly scalable, secure, and modern web application leveraging the following technologies:

### Frontend
* **React:** For building a fast and dynamic user interface.
* **Vite:** As the build tool for rapid development.
* **Tailwind CSS / Shadcn UI:** For utility-first styling and pre-built, accessible components.
* **React Router:** For client-side routing.

### Backend / Database / Auth
* **Supabase:** Used as the primary **PostgreSQL** database, API, and file storage.
* **Clerk:** Used for robust and highly customizable **user authentication** and managing user roles (`unsafeMetadata`).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following accounts and keys:

1.  **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2.  **npm** or **yarn**
3.  **Clerk Account:** For authentication.
4.  **Supabase Account:** For the database and file storage.

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/satish-ray/hirrd.git](https://github.com/satish-ray/hirrd.git)
cd hirrd

### 2. Install Dependencies

npm install
 or
yarn install

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a file named **`.env`** in the root of the project and add your Clerk and Supabase credentials. These are essential for connecting the frontend to your services:

### Clerk Credentials
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

### Supabase Credentials
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="[https://your-project-id.supabase.co](https://your-project-id.supabase.co)"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI..."

### 4. Configure Supabase

You must configure your Supabase instance to integrate with Clerk for authentication and set up the necessary data structures:

1.  **Database Setup:** Create the necessary tables (`companies`, `jobs`, `applications`, `saved_jobs`).
2.  **Clerk JWT Integration:** Implement the **PostgreSQL function** that verifies and uses Clerk JWT tokens within Supabase. This is crucial for enabling **Row Level Security (RLS)** based on user identity.
3.  **Storage:** Create a new storage bucket named **`resumes`** for resume uploads and set the appropriate RLS policies to ensure candidates can only upload their own files securely.

### 5. Run the Project

Start the local development server:

npm run dev
 or
yarn dev
The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173.

## üí° Future Enhancements

* **Recruiter Analytics:** Implement a dashboard for recruiters to view application statistics and funnel conversions.
* **Candidate Profile:** Allow candidates to create a detailed profile with skills, work history, and portfolio links.
* **Notifications:** Implement real-time notifications for application status changes and job alerts.
